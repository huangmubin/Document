It's beautiful, Mark.
I am so tired.
Can you drive?
What's that supposed to mean?
I mean, I can drive. But there?
I'm sorry Mark. I can drive, but I'm not very good at it.
Sarah, I love driving. But it's tiring.
I can't do it every day.
OK.
Let's try.
Are you OK?
Mm	hmm.
Let's... uhh... Let's go that way.
OK.
Sorry.
I love driving at home in England.
It's fun.
But here in the US? I don't know.
In the UK, we drive on the left side of the load. Not the right.


Hey, Joe. What are we going to do tonight?
I know! Let's go to that play downtown.
Nah, it's too far.
Well, what else is going on?
Well, there's a new movie at the theater. It's 'The Big Cheese' with May Jackson.
Or we could go to the football game?
I do not enjoy watching football games.
Oh, yeah. So the movie sounds good.
Great!

Could you do me a favor?
That's more like it.


Sally. Could you do me a favor?
Sure. What do you need?
Well, Angela and I want to do something special this weekend. It's our 20th wedding anniversary.
Wow! Twenty years together. Congratulations.
Thanks. The think is, we don't go out a lot, and I really don't know...
Could you help me find something interesting?
Sure. Um, no problem.
Springdale.com has all the events listed for the city.
It covers the concert hall, the auditorium... You really should check it out.
That's a good idea.
There's an incredible samba band at the Blue Banana.
That's the hottest nightclub in town right now. Do you and Angela like to dance?
Hmm. I really don't dance. Is there something a little more, kind of...
Traditional.
Yes! Like a classical concert. Beethoven. Or Mozart.
Here's a play. How about Shakespeare? It's 'Hamlet'.
Hmm. That's more like it.
It's in the Main Street Theater on Saturday.
Angela loves plays. Thank you so much!
You're welcome!
