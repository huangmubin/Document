It's beautiful, Mark.
I am so tired.
Can you drive?
What's that supposed to mean?
I mean, I can drive. But there?
I'm sorry Mark. I can drive, but I'm not very good at it.
Sarah, I love driving. But it's tiring.
I can't do it every day.
OK.
Let's try.
Are you OK?
Mm	hmm.
Let's... uhh... Let's go that way.
OK.
Sorry.
I love driving at home in England.
It's fun.
But here in the US? I don't know.
In the UK, we drive on the left side of the load. Not the right.


Hey, Joe. What are we going to do tonight?
I know! Let's go to that play downtown.
Nah, it's too far.
Well, what else is going on?
Well, there's a new movie at the theater. It's 'The Big Cheese' with May Jackson.
Or we could go to the football game?
I do not enjoy watching football games.
Oh, yeah. So the movie sounds good.
Great!

Could you do me a favor?
That's more like it.


Sally. Could you do me a favor?
Sure. What do you need?
Well, Angela and I want to do something special this weekend. It's our 20th wedding anniversary.
Wow! Twenty years together. Congratulations.
Thanks. The think is, we don't go out a lot, and I really don't know...
Could you help me find something interesting?
Sure. Um, no problem.
Springdale.com has all the events listed for the city.
It covers the concert hall, the auditorium... You really should check it out.
That's a good idea.
There's an incredible samba band at the Blue Banana.
That's the hottest nightclub in town right now. Do you and Angela like to dance?
Hmm. I really don't dance. Is there something a little more, kind of...
Traditional.
Yes! Like a classical concert. Beethoven. Or Mozart.
Here's a play. How about Shakespeare? It's 'Hamlet'.
Hmm. That's more like it.
It's in the Main Street Theater on Saturday.
Angela loves plays. Thank you so much!
You're welcome!


## 3 计划于朋友晚上外出

Oh! There's a samba band at, uh...
Nah, I can't dance to samba.
You can't dance to anything.
What?
Why don't we go to that new sports bar on, uh, Grove Street?
Harmon's?
Yeah! They're probably showing the football game.
I hate sports bars.
Really? Why?
Because they're boring. The music's always so loud, it's difficult to have a conversation.
How about a quiet, relaxing dinner with Pam and Simon?
We do that every night.
Okay. You're right. Let's do something different.
I know! Let's go to a movie. "The Now York killer."
A horror movie? I don't think so. How about a romance, or a drama?
Ugh.
Hey, look! They're playing "Chinatown" at the Roxie Theater.
Really? It's a classic!
Yeah. I saw it years ago. It was incredible.
I'd love to see it again. Can you book the tickets?
Sure thing.
Thanks, Jake. I'm gonna go get ready.
Okay.


Hi, Ann! Hey, how was your vacation? You went to Now York, right?
Yeah.
How was it?
Oh, I love Now York! It's a really exciting city.
Hmm. It's too big and too loud for me. So, what do you do in Now York?
Well, we went to a musical. That was fun! And we ate at some really interesting restaurants. The food was dilicous.
It sounds wonderful.
And the Museum of Modern Art was incredible!
That's great! Well, I have a meeting. See you later.
Bye.

Okay! Okay! I'm ready.
Did you book the tickets?
The tickets?
The tickets. You booked them, right?
Ohhh.
I can't believe it. How could you forget to book the tickets? The 8 o'clock show is sold out now.
Sally, I'm really sorry. Is there a second show?
The next show begins at 10:30. There are still some tickets left. But it's over after midnight.
That sounds good. I'm so sorry. I can't believe I forget. So, uh, do you want to watch some TV?
This is so stupid!


Good afternoon. Springdale Theater.
